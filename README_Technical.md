# AI-Powered Personal Daily Assistant - Technical Interview Project

## Welcome!

This technical interview project challenges you to build an intelligent personal assistant that helps users manage their daily activities through natural conversation. You'll demonstrate your expertise in multi-agent AI systems, modern web development, and API integration.

## What You'll Build

An AI assistant system featuring:
- **Real-time Chat Interface** built with React and TypeScript
- **Intent Analysis** with proper and smart intent analysis logic / algorithm / agent
- **Specialized AI Agents** working together using OpenAI Agents SDK
- **Multi-Protocol Architecture, Building and Integration** using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tools among the application
- **Knowledge-Enhanced Responses** with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Free API Integrations** for weather, recipes, news, and more

## Project Files

This package contains everything you need to get started:

- **`candidate_project_requirements.md`** - Complete project requirements and specifications
- **`technical_architecture_guide.md`** - System overview and key concepts
- **`api_documentation_guide.md`** - Comprehensive documentation for all free APIs you'll use
- **`README.md`** - This file with getting started information

## Quick Start

### 1. Review the Requirements
Start by reading `candidate_project_requirements.md` to understand the full scope and expectations.

### 2. Study the System Overview
Review `technical_architecture_guide.md` to understand the key system components and concepts.

### 3. Explore the APIs
Check `api_documentation_guide.md` for detailed information about the free APIs you'll integrate.

### 4. Set Up Your Environment
You'll need:
- Python 3.8+ for backend development
- Node.js 16+ for frontend development
- OpenAI API key (will be provided)
- Git for version control

### 5. Plan Your Implementation
Design your own approach and timeline for implementing the system. Consider how you'll structure the multi-agent system, organize the MCP servers, and create an effective user interface.

## Key Technologies

### Required Technologies
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** - For multi-agent system implementation
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - For standardized API integration
- **React + TypeScript** - For frontend development
- **Fast API** - For backend API development
- **Vector Database** - For RAG implementation (Chroma recommended)

### Free APIs Included
- **Open-Meteo** - Weather data (no API key required)
- **TheMealDB** - Recipe database (completely free)
- **The News API** - News aggregation (free tier)
- **JSONPlaceholder** - Development/testing data

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be evaluated on:
- **Technical Implementation** - Proper use of required technologies
- **System Integration** - How well components work together
- **User Experience** - Quality of the chat interface and interactions
- **Code Quality** - Organization, documentation, and best practices
