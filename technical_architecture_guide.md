# Technical Architecture Guide: AI-Powered Personal Daily Assistant

## System Overview

The Personal Daily Assistant is a multi-agent AI system that combines several modern technologies to create an intelligent conversational interface. The system integrates the OpenAI Agents SDK for agent orchestration, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for external API access, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge enhancement.

## Key Components

### Multi-Agent System
The system uses specialized AI agents that collaborate to handle different types of user requests. Each agent has specific capabilities and can hand off conversations to other agents when needed. The agents work together to provide comprehensive assistance across various daily life topics.

### Model Context Protocol Integration
MCP servers provide standardized access to external APIs and data sources. This protocol-based approach enables clean separation between agent logic and external resource access, making the system more maintainable and scalable.

### RAG Knowledge System
A knowledge base enhances agent responses with curated information about daily life topics, best practices, and contextual guidance. The system uses vector search to retrieve relevant information that agents can incorporate into their responses.

### Real-Time Interface
The frontend provides a responsive chat interface that communicates with the backend through both REST APIs and WebSocket connections for real-time updates and agent status information.

## Technology Integration Points

### OpenAI Agents SDK
- Agent creation and management
- Handoff/Tooling mechanisms between agents
- Tool integration for external capabilities
- Conversation context preservation

### MCP Protocol
- Server implementation for different API categories
- Client usage flexible for various agents
- Resource and tool definitions
- Protocol message handling
- Error handling and retry logic

### RAG Implementation
- Vector database for semantic search
- Knowledge base organization
- Retrieval integration with agent responses
- Content curation and management

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- RESTful API endpoints for standard operations
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- State management for conversation history
- Error handling and user feedback

## Development Considerations

### Agent Design
Consider how to structure agent responsibilities, implement effective handoff mechanisms, and maintain conversation context across agent interactions. Think about error handling and fallback strategies when agents encounter issues.

### API Integration
Plan how to organize MCP servers for different types of external resources. Consider rate limiting, error handling, and data transformation requirements for each API integration.

### Knowledge Management
Design strategies for organizing and retrieving knowledge that enhances agent responses. Consider how to balance retrieval performance with response relevance and accuracy.

### User Experience
Plan how to provide clear feedback about agent activities, handle real-time updates, and maintain responsive performance during complex multi-agent workflows.

This guide provides the conceptual framework for understanding the system components and their interactions. The specific implementation details and architectural decisions are part of what you'll design and implement as part of this project.
